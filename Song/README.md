# `GigglesAndCode`: Line-by-Line Song Printer 🎵💻

Welcome to `GigglesAndCode`! Dive into a charming Python script that prints song lyrics one letter at a time, making each line feel like a personal performance. Perfect for adding a touch of magic to your command line experience!

## ✨ How It Works

This script takes a list of song lines and displays each letter with a slight delay, creating a typing effect. Whether you're feeling nostalgic or just want to add a bit of flair to your text output, this script does the trick!

## 📝 Code Overview

Here's how the magic happens:

1. **Import Libraries**: We use `time` to handle delays and `sys` to manage output.
2. **Function Definition**: `print_line_by_line` takes your song lines and prints them letter by letter.
3. **Song Lines**: Customize the `song_lines` list with your favorite lyrics or messages.
4. **Execution**: Run the script to see your lyrics come to life, one character at a time!

## 💡 Customization

Feel free to adjust the `delay` parameter to make the typing effect faster or slower. Add your own lyrics to the `song_lines` list for a personalized touch!

## 🎶 Example

```python
import time
import sys

def print_line_by_line(song_lines, delay=0.1):
    # Your function code here

song_lines = [
    "Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,",
    "With you between my arms.",
    "Barefoot on the grass",
    "Listening to our favorite song",
    "I have faith in what I see",
    "Now I know I have met an angel in person",
    "And she looks perfect"
]

print_line_by_line(song_lines, delay=0.1)
```

Enjoy the little performance right in your terminal!
